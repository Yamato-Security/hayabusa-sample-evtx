Sample EVTX Repository:

The sample .evtx files come from the following repositories:
- [DeepBlueCLI](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI) - Attack detection tool written in Powershell.
- [EVTX ATTACK Samples](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES) - EVTX attack sample event log files by [SBousseaden](https://twitter.com/SBousseaden).
- [EVTX-to-MITRE-Attack](https://github.com/mdecrevoisier/EVTX-to-MITRE-Attack) - Another great repository of EVTX attack sample logs mapped to ATT&CK.

as well as originally created .evtx files from Yamato Security.

We are trying to gather as many evtx files as we can for detection engineering.
